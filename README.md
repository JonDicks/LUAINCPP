This file incorperates LUA into an Xcode™ project. 

From http://www.lua.org/about.html (the official LUA website) i quote, "Lua is free open-source software, distributed under a very liberal license (the well-known MIT license). It may be used for any purpose, including commercial purposes, at absolutely no cost. Just download it and use it." therefore this project is allowed to use the code it incorpereates.
