**  THIS TEST IS INTENDED TO SHOW HOW TO:                             **
**      CREATE A LUA ENVIRONMENT,                                     **
**      TEST THAT THE LUA ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN CREATED                **
**      CREATE A LUA INTEGER,                                         **
**      ADD THAT INTEGER TO THE STACK,                                **
**      INCREMENT THAT INTEGER IN A FOR LOOP,                         **
**      PRINT THE INTEGER TO CONSOLE,                                 **
**      REMOVE THE INTEGER FROM THE STACK,                            **
**      AND CHECK THAT THE INTEGER HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE STACK.   **
